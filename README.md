## Did you know that you can optimize memory by changing the order of struct fields in Go?

![Mind blown](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaHVmZ2hjeHg4em1vZjdnN284Zmt5cWs2YnUzYWk0M3d5dW16OW9jaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/lXu72d4iKwqek/giphy.gif)

Its fascinating! Right?

I didn't know this until I saw this for myself in a reddit thread's example. Now this is not a new thing. Programming languages like C/C++ already has this concepts up and running for decades.

Turns out, most processors access data more efficiently when data is aligned to certain byte boundaries (e.g., 2, 4, 8 bytes). For instance, an int64 (which is 8 bytes) is most efficiently accessed when stored at a memory address that is a multiple of 8. To achieve this alignment, Go automatically adds padding between fields in a struct. This padding can increase the size of a struct if fields are not ordered optimally.

By ordering fields from largest to smallest, you minimise the amount of padding required between fields, resulting in a smaller overall memory footprint.

Here are the links where I found this:-

## I stumbled upon an intriguing string-to-number conversion technique in JavaScript

"1000.01"*1 is faster than Number("1000.01")

![Fast!!!!](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcnU2NXl3dHdvMjFhYjN0dnd4Y3lzeGVsaW90ZzUwaGZ0N2V0bGMzMSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3ornjYNHp6WwEdq3cc/giphy.gif)

The operation "1000.01"*1 involves using the multiplication operator with a numeric value (1), which implicitly converts the string to a number and is generally faster because it's a simple operation involving the multiplication operator. In contrast, Number("1000.01") requires calling a function (Number), which introduces some overhead.

Now, that doesnâ€™t mean you're going to replace every line of string-to-number conversion code that uses the (Number) function with multiplication by 1. 
ðŸ˜… 

While it is fast, you might encounter some precision issues, so you should avoid using it in places where precision is critical.

There is a good Stack Overflow thread discussing various string-to-number conversion techniques in JavaScript and their benchmarks. Definitely check it out.
